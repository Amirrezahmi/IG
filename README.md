# Self-Talker-AI

Imagine being able to converse with a version of yourself that can provide answers to any question you may have. This project aimed to achieve just that!

You can now engage in a conversation with yourself and seek answers to questions that may have previously eluded you.

Using cutting-edge machine learning techniques such as NLP, voice cloning, deep fake technology, etc., we have created a virtual version of you that can seamlessy communicate with you. This AI-powered version of yourself is capable of understanding the nuances of human language and can provide insightful and accurate responses to your queries.

So, whether you're seeking advice on a personal matter, looking for guidance in your career, or simply curious about the world around you, this AI-powered version of yourself is always at your disposal.

With this project, the possibilities are endless. You can have conversations with your virtual self.
